# Connect Four Simulator
A Connect Four game written in Python where different algorithms face off against each other. This was done in my Intro to A.I. class in Fall 2022.

## Introduction

Connect Four Simulator is a Python-based implementation of Connect Four, where different algorithms compete against each other. The game showcases battles between players using various strategies, inluding random moves, alpha-beta pruning, and A-star search.

## Algorithms

The simulator includes the following algorithms:
1. **Random Player**: Makes random moves.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning Player**: Utilizes the alpha-beta pruning strategy.
3. **A-star Player**: Applies the A-star search strategy.

This simulator also includes the basic minimax algorithm to showcase the performance gains achieved by alpha-beta pruning.

## Features

* Automated battles between different algorithms
* Results display showing wins, losses, draws.
* Customizable number of games and board settings.
* You can display the gameboard as well (I have commented that out because seeing 1000 different game boards flash in front of my face is a lot).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
```https://github.com/<your-username-here>/connect-four-sim.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
```cd connect-four-sim```
3. Run the simulator:  
```python ConnectFour-sim.py```  
(If you have multiple Python versions, using `python3` instead.)
